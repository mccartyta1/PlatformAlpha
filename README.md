# PlatformAlpha
Don't give the name much thought, as it is simply the name that has stuck with the project for a while. 
PlatformAlpha is an another of my attempts to give a player good amounts of choice in how they tackle the game. 
In the beginning, the player is given the choice of which powers they would like to use. From there, they can use 
those powers to defeat the basic enemies I've added to the relatively simple levels.


# Features:
Some basic system to talk to NPCs, just allowing advancement of dialog.

Several Powers

Level Creation, prints code that I can just copy and paste into a room creation function.
(Quick thing right now, should load from a .txt file or something, but this seemed faster at the moment.)

Basic Enemies to pew at, allowing NPCs to be targeted as well. 

I was also testing using images, so the player has a rather static image to represent them.


# Future Goals:
Add more powers and more enemy types.

Boss Battles. Always need Boss Battles.

Some sort of Allies System.
